## Welcome to TA session of Statistics and Econometrics II

This website contains all material for TA session. The material includes one slides for brief outline and two lecture notes of Stata and R for practicing. I will update weekly slides and lecture notes before TA session.

The aim of this website is for convenience to find different types of files. However, the material in each week will also be uploaded to [the course website](https://cool.ntu.edu.tw/courses/213).

Any questions or suggestions are encouraged, and feel free to contact me whether in person or via email: r05323035@ntu.edu.tw.
